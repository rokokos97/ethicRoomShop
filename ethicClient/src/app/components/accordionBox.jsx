                <span className="text-secondary">
                  All orders are shipped on the basis of DDU
                  (Delivery Duty Unpaid),
                  which means that your order may be subject to local taxes
                  and / or import duties levied by your local customs
                  authorities.
                  Product prices are shown without all taxes and fees.
                  We are unable to calculate the exact amount of duties
                  and taxes that your order may require,
                  as these fees are charged directly by the country of delivery.
